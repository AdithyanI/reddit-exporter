Still, when we'll have better local models, OpenAI and others will have much better and the gap will always be there, as long as they keep innovating.\n\nEven if they don't, they have a ton of compute to throw at it, which you don't have locally.",

Lets say you have a 20 layer model, and two 8GB GPU's. For simplicity, lets say each layer uses 1GB of VRAM, you put 8 layers on one GPU, 8 layers on the other, the remaining layers (4) go into system RAM. So when you begin your inference forward pass through the model, the first GPU uses it's processing power on the 8 layers it has in it's own memory, the attention mechanism then moves into the second GPU, where it uses it's own processing power on it's 8 layers, finally the attention mechanism moves to the CPU of the computer where it passes through the 4 final layers in system RAM.\n\nThe first 8 layers are computed at the speed of the GPU, the second 8 layers are computed at the speed of the second GPU, the final 4 layers are processed at the speed of the CPU+RAM.\n\nThings to keep in mind.\n\n- splitting models across different GPU's/accelerators is known as \"tensor splitting\"\n\n- most of this shit only works as expected using Nvidia CUDA (although AMD ROCm and Vulkan are improving)\n\n- tensor splitting is unique to inference engines and formats (not all formats and engines can do this)\n\n- whenever possible, moving layers to a dedicated accelerator is in practice ALWAYS faster than using a CPU+RAM, hence why VRAM is king, CUDA is the boss, and Nvidia is worth a gajillion dollars\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt, we're all novices in a field of computing that literally invalidates itself almost entirely every 6 months.",

Here's how this estimate is derived:\n\n1. **Historical Pricing Trends**:\n   * The RTX 3090, with 24 GB of memory, was priced between $1,000 and $1,300.\n   * The RTX 4090, also with 24 GB, saw a significant price increase to around $2,000.\n   * This indicates a trend where flagship GPUs see substantial price jumps between generations.\n2. **Memory Capacity and Pricing**:\n   * The RTX 4090 is priced at approximately $83 per GB ($2,000/24 GB).\n   * Applying a similar or slightly higher price per GB to the RTX 5090 (due to new technology and performance improvements) results in:\n      * $83 × 32 GB = $2,656\n      * Considering market factors and potential premium pricing, this could round up to between $2,500 and $3,000.\n3. **Comparison with Professional GPUs**:\n   * The NVIDIA A6000, a professional GPU with 48 GB of memory, is priced at $4,800.\n   * While professional GPUs are typically more expensive due to additional features and optimizations for professional workloads, the pricing provides a ceiling for high-memory GPUs.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven these factors, a reasonable estimate for the RTX 5090's price would be in the **$2,500 to $3,000** range. However, please note that this is a speculative estimate. The actual price could vary based on NVIDIA's pricing strategy, manufacturing costs, competition, and market demand at the time of release.",

Can I choose different Whisper implementation instead of WhisperX? Yea, I can spend hour trying to find something that works, then have no docs or help online because virtually nobody uses that and then, when I'll get this working it will be 10x slower than WhisperX implementation.\n\nNo matter what comes next, if you want to play with it be prepared to wait, because AMD just doesn't invest in their ecosystem enough so until it gets traction there won't be any port, it will CUDA-only.\n\n  \nOpenAI, Microsoft etc. use only Nvidia hardware to do all stuff, because Nvidia invested heavily in their ecosystem and Nvidia has clear vision. AMD lacks that vision, their engineers make a good product, their marketing team has fuckups everytime they touch anything (Ryzen 9000 release clearly showed how bad AMD marketing team is, bad reviews for good product, all because marketing hyped it way too much) and then they have no idea how many years they will support that - its like they would toss a coin to see how many years it will be alive.

In fact, they decrease safety, not only because reduce open research, but also because more people will depend on corporations even if they or their busyness would be better off running things locally otherwise. But such law would help established corporations to achieve regulatory capture and reduce number of competitors, thus increasing their profit. There is literally nothing else such law would accomplish.\n\nIn the meantime China's models are getting better and better. For example, Qwen2-VL works better in my tests than new Llama3.2 90B. Molmo 72B based on Qwen2-VL is pretty good too (Molmo 72B based on it seems to be great as well). Qwen2.5 72B is quite comparable in capabilities against Llama 70B, in some tasks even better. If Meta would not be allowed to keep up, then it will be left behind - I imagine Qwen3 will have even better capabilities, so Meta has to release Llama 4 in reasonable amount of time in order to keep the lead.",

The general low to mid level patterns and details needed for the implementation are already available in the codebase - from model conversion, to data loading, backend usage and inference. It would take some high-level understanding of the project architecture in order to implement support for the vision models and extend the API in the correct way.\n\n> We really need more people with this sort of skillset, so at this point I feel it is better to wait and see if somebody will show up and take the opportunity to help out with the project long-term. Otherwise, I'm afraid we won't be able to sustain the quality of the project.\n\nSo better to not hold our collective breath.
