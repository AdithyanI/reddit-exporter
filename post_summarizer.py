```json
{
    "title": "OpenAI plans to slowly raise prices to $44 per month ($528 per year)",
    "comment_summaries": [
        {
            "id": "post_2_c1",
            "score": 267,
            "comment_summary": "The top-level comment expresses a strong preference for using locally-run models over proprietary services like ChatGPT, emphasizing control, cost-effectiveness, and stability."
        },
        {
            "id": "post_2_c2",
            "score": 488,
            "comment_summary": "This comment discusses the implications of running AI models locally versus using cloud-based services, with a focus on OpenAI's competition, financial model, and sustainability."
        },
        {
            "id": "post_2_c3",
            "score": 191,
            "comment_summary": "Several comments reflect users' intention to stop using OpenAI services due to the price increase, with some users considering alternative AI solutions."
        },
        {
            "id": "post_2_c4",
            "score": 17,
            "comment_summary": "This comment highlights the negative reaction to OpenAI's shift away from open-source models and their call for AI regulation, alongside skepticism about users adopting local AI solutions."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example Output:**

The community discusses OpenAIâ€™s plan to raise subscription prices to $44 per month. Users express a strong preference for locally-run AI models, citing concerns about price increases and the desire for more control over proprietary services like ChatGPT. Commentary also explores OpenAI's competition, financial model, and the sustainability of its business practices. Additionally, there is debate over whether users will continue using OpenAI services or seek alternative AI solutions in response to the price hike.
